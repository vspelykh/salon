/**
 * The model package contains classes that represent the data model of the application. The model layer is responsible
 * for encapsulating and managing data, and providing services to the other layers of the application.
 * <p>
 * The package includes the following sub-packages:
 * <ul>
 *      <li> The "dao" package contains classes that implement the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern for accessing
 *           and manipulating data from a database or other persistence mechanism. </li>
 *      <li> The "dto" package contains classes that define Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to encapsulate data and
 *           transfer it between the layers of the application. </li>
 *      <li> The "entity" package contains classes that represent the domain entities of the application. </li
 * </ul>
 * Together, these sub-packages provide a comprehensive data management solution for the application, with the DAOs
 * providing data access, DTOs providing data transfer and conversion, and entities defining the domain data model.
